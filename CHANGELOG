Changelog
=========

0.2 (unreleased)
----------------

Planned:
- dumper class
- dictionary that contains the order un which the items of a node must be
  rendered

0.1.4 (unreleased):
-------------------

Planned:
- <del>in the function "lambda_" in dumper.py, there is a call to a now deleted
  function "funcdef_argument", this will crash a redering of lambda</del> in
  fact, this case won't happen since "argument" isn't a FST node anymore, this is
  just dead code that needs to be clean. This will be removed from the CHANGELOG

0.1.3 (2014-04-13)
------------------

- set sugar syntaxic notation wasn't handled by the dumper (apparently no one
  use this on pypi top 100)

0.1.2 (2014-04-08)
------------------

- baron.dumps now accept a signle FST node, it was only working with a list of
  FST nodes
- don't add a endl node at the end if not present in the input string
- de-uniformise call_arguments and function_arguments node, this is just
  creating more problems that anything else
- fix https://github.com/Psycojoker/redbaron/issues/4
- fix the fact that baron can't parse "{1,}" (but "{1}" is working)

0.1.1 (2014-03-23)
------------------
