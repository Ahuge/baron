Changelog
=========

0.1.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- baron.dumps now accept a signle FST node, it was only working with a list of
  FST nodes

Planned:

- don't add a endl node at the end if not present in the input string
- de-uniformise call_arguments and function_arguments node, this is just
  creating more problems that anything else
